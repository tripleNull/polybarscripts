# Dependencies
Font Awesome - To display the Bitcoin glyph.
Coinbase python API - To pull down current Bitcoin price. Clone this from the official github repository rather than installing via pip, this will avoid issues with older iterations of the API.

# FYI
prices-polybar-module.txt - Need to have font awesome installed for this to display correctly. Edit the format-prefix attribute to remove the glyph if necessary.
